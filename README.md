# Snake game
The project is my implementation of simplified version of classic Snake game.
It was written in modern C++ using QtCreator and Qt libraries.

See screenshot.jpg for quick glance at game window.

Run release/Snake.exe to start the game.

Hold space key for temporary snake speed bost. Adjust speed slider or press num +/- to increase/decrease game speed.
